Configuration
=============

Basic configuration
-------------------

Configure the access rules for different URI paths. `path` defines the URI path for the current rule. The `read` configuration belongs to the HTTP methods GET and HEAD. Any other method will be treated as `write`.

The default access is defined with the path `all`:

```typo3_typoscript
plugin.tx_rest.settings.paths {
    all {
        path = all
        read = deny
        write = deny
    }
}
```

Allow read and write access to the model `MyModel` of the extension `MyExt`:

```typo3_typoscript
#...
my_ext-my_model {
    path = my_ext-my_model
    read = allow
    write = allow
}
#...
```

Allow read and write access for all models of the extension `MySecondext`:

```typo3_typoscript
#...
my_secondext {
    path = my_secondext-*
    read = allow
    write = allow
}
#...
```

Additionally you can require a valid user login for write operations:

```typo3_typoscript
#...
my_protectedext {
    path = my_protectedext-*
    read = allow
    write = require
}
#...
```

### Namespaces and vendor prefix

Extensions that are created with a vendor prefix have to include their prefix into the path. `\Vendor\MyExtension\Domain\Model\MyModel` as an example would need the path `vendor-my_ext-my_model`.

```typo3_typoscript
#...
vendor-my_ext-my_model {
    path = vendor-my_ext-my_model
    read = allow
    write = deny
}
#...
```


Advanced configuration
----------------------

### Aliases

Often the full path for a model doesn't fit the clients expectations. To make the paths looking better, path aliases can be defined:

```typo3_typoscript
plugin.tx_rest.settings.aliases {
    the_alias = my_ext-my_model
}
```


### Root object for collection

Some clients expect a returned data collection to have a root object, others don't. If an array output like the one below meets your demands no further configuration is required.

```json5
[
    {
        "uid": 9,
        "name": "Daniel"
    },
    {
        "uid": 10,
        "name": "Paul"
    }
    /* ... */
]
```

If you require an output like the following you can enable `plugin.tx_rest.settings.addRootObjectForCollection = 1`
(This setting will **NOT** apply to custom handlers)

```json5
{
    "users": [
        {
            "uid": 9,
            "name": "Daniel"
        },
        {
            "uid": 10,
            "name": "Paul"
        }
        /* ... */
    ]
}
```

This wraps the whole response array into an object with the key read from the request path (i.e. `users`).

Tip: The request path will be used as root key, so you may want to configure aliases.
