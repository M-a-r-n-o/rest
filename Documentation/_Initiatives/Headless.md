Headless
========

A modern CMS has to serve a lot of different platforms. 
From the classic desktop computer, over smartphone and tablet 
displays to PWA and native apps.

With a headless CMS the content can be managed in a well known 
way and be published to be consumed by whatever frontend best 
suites the project requirements.

The REST extension builds a solid foundation to fulfill the 
needs of a headless CMS project.
